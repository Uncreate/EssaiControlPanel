  The install of "EssaiControlPanel" consists of 3 parts. Extracting
the ZIP to a folder, registering the .NET dll, and setting the COM port number.

// Step 1
- Create a folder named "C:\EssaiControlPanel" on the root in c:\ drive.
- Extract the ZIP contents directly to that folder (make sure no subfolders exists from extracting ZIP)

// Step 2
- Open a Command Prompt with "Run as Administrator"
- Run the following line to register the .NET dll
  "C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\RegAsm.exe" "C:\EssaiControlPanel\Balluffwrapper.dll"
**Note: The "v4.0.30319" version of .NET maybe different on each computer, replace "v4.0.30319" with highest version on target computer

// Step 3
- Open device manager and find out the COM port number being used by the RFID device
- Open the "config.txt" and change the number next to "port" to match COM port on computer. (Found in "Balluff_settings" group in config.txt)


**Note**
- Application assumed that "some version of .NET is installed". (Almost every program requires .NET nowadays)
  If the computer does not have .NET, you can install any version higher than 4.0 directly from Microsoft
- Application is using "Microsoft Redistributables 2015", but for simplicity I have included the following DLLs in the application folder
  This bypasses the need to install "Microsoft Redistributables 2015" package.
  If you prefer to use the install package, then install them and delete the following DLLs out of the application folder
   ..msvcp140.dll
   ..vcruntime140.dll
